Introduction

Soundbawx is an old project that I did in college. It was an assignment that we had to do in team, so I paired with a friend, Philippe Tremblay.

I recreated the history from a CVS repository that I found in an old hard drive. I had to rewrite some commit information like the author and the message encoding (ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8). You can see the file update-history to see how I did that.

I didn't try to recompile it so I don't know if it works. Also, I think there is a GUI made with MFC so I can't compile it on my computer right now because I use OSX.
